# PROJECT Etch-a-Sketch

I built a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-a-Sketch.


Project allows user to:
- Create a sketchpad of desired size by pressing 'Generate Canvas' button

- Paint any square on hover

- press 'Clear' to wipe off the paint to start off on a clean canvas.

- Select either 'yellow', 'blue', 'green', or 'brown' buttons to
change the background color of the non-hovered part of the grid


Project demonstrates my understanding of:

- DOM manipulation (dynamically creating child elements and appending to parent; using JS to style elements, using JS to add/remove class using element.classList.add/remove() functions)

- CSS Flexbox model (Using CSS & JS to create perfect square grids without clipping/overflowing squares)


A luta continua, vitória é certa
